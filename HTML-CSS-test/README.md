This is a mini project for applying basic HTML & CSS knowledge to make a simple
website as fast as possible and time myself

Rules:

1. the website should be responsive; putting it on widescreen should not 
affect its readability.

2. you should utilize css selector so the border separates each blog post 
appropriately

3. you should use open sans for the font.

Some tips:

1. you can actually set the css attribute for < body> tag

2. you can set the width to %, which will change according to the screen width

3. you can set max-width to prevent the component from getting too wide
